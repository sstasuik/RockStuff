Rocks are just flying around.

Making a game similar to a tutorial I found called the Joy of Code.
In this game The asteroids move throughout space turning randomly.
These Asteroids have the ability to destroy space ships when they collide.

As of July 24 2020,
The user is able to move the Rocket using the keys "WASD" and can collide with RocketFuel to completly remove it from space.

On July 25 2020,
the user can boost the Rocket using the "R" key.
